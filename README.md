# Video_Frames_Sorting_Challenge-MachineHack_June2024

🧩 Here's a puzzle to tickle your brains! 🧠

Overview:
A sequence of 100 frames has been extracted and jumbled-up from a short video snapshot of traffic of vehicles moving across a portion of the road from right to left. 🚗 ⬅️ ⬅️️ 🚗 The expectation from participants is to assign the right sequence index to the frames by extracting/using relevant feature templates from the images and deducing the logic to order the frames in the right sequence as per the video.

Dataset:
The data-set contains the following elements:
📂 Randomized Images: Contains frame images with random integers assigned to the file names to jumble the right order.
📂 Feature Templates: Contains vehicle images from the frames which are properly identified within the frames in a gray-scaled version. The file name of the images is in the order of their appearance within the video.
📂 Submission Template: Sample template similar to the file format acceptable for submission.
📂 Readme file: Contains a hint to solve the problem.

Skills:
🔍 Basics of Image Processing.

Hackathon Specific Rules

Evaluation metric used is the RMSE (Root mean squared error) calculation between actual order of frames and provided value.

Effective and successful implementation of image to template matching techniques is the goal of the hackathon.

The leading submissions will be displayed over MachineHack hackathon leaderboard.

Interesting solutions and approaches will be invited to be showcased over the platform for global viewership.
